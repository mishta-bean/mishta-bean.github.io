Known issues:

* Selecting a tab adjacent to
  a recently deleted tab causes
  the old multiplication table to
  become "zombified" once a new table
  is saved.
  Only occurred when rapidly saving
  duplicate tables.

    The potential cause is the way
    each new tab is indexed.

* The multiple-deletion option is very
  inconsistent, with many tabs having
  an "unknown" checkbox state, despite
  having a checkbox with the same class
  name as the others.
